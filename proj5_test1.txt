'Sports' is a broad term that basically refers to diverse forms of physical activities that are competitive in natur\
e. Participation in sports is aimed at utilizing or maintaining, as well as improving one's physical capabilities, a\
s well as the skills of the game. Moreover, the individuals participating in certain sports activities, together wit\
h spectators, are entertained by this physical competition. Activities like football are effective in nurturing phys\
ical health and developing good interaction skills. Historic artifacts suggest that the earliest sporting activities\
 took place in China many centuries ago. At the time sports originated, gymnastics were the most popular kind of spo\
rt among people in ancient China. In the same way, suggestive artifacts were found in Egypt, with monuments indicati\
ng that traditional sports like fishing and swimming were well developed in the region. Correspondingly, ancient Per\
sians were fond of martial arts, jousting, and polo. Another civilization that embraced sports was ancient Greece be\
cause the culture that was predominantly focused on sports. Greece played a crucial part in the development of sport\
s. We all know the famous Olympic Games competition that was created in Greece. For those who think about engaging i\
n sport, the great news is that numerous sports exist today, which means you're not going to have problems with pick\
ing one that suits you well. Some require two participants, while others involve larger groups or more individuals. \
Sports activities can be classified into two main categories, the broadest and most popular one being physical activ\
ities. For instance, physical sports include various activities that take place during the worldwide Olympic Games c\
ompetitions. First Olympic Games were held in 1896 in Athens, and today the most famous competition typically includ\
es thirty-three different sports, such as aquatics, weightlifting, wrestling, hockey, football, badminton, boxing, c\
anoe, gymnastics, handball, judo, karate, sailing, shooting, and many others. In addition to physical games, sports \
also include mind games that are common among different generations. For example, chess, as well as bridge, have com\
e to be recognized as special forms of sport. Nonetheless, not all mind games can be called sports. One criterion fo\
r consideration as a sport is that the activity should incorporate the so-called competitive element. Secondly, the \
activity should not cause harm to any living thing, and winning should not depend on luck. From these criteria, one \
might expand the list of activities that can be categorized as sports. For instance, physically involved activities \
like rugby and other physical competitions are sports. In the same way, predominantly motorized activities like powe\
r boating, as well as Formula I, are appropriately perceived as sports. The key point is that the defining aspect of\
 competition must be apparent. This infers that an activity where the grading of participants exists on the basis of\
 results is definitely qualified as a sport. In conclusion, activities that do not include the element of competitio\
n between two or more individuals or teams are not considered sports. In contrast, the activities that do include co\
mpetition with others can be considered a sport. What are the benefits of sports and games? In addition to boosting \
one's physical strength, sports also tend to develop social skills as people start interacting with their teammates,\
 as well as the opponents. Being engaged in sports boosts your ability to work on a team and helps you get used to t\
he culture of it, which can be highly advantageous in the professional sector as well. What is more, even being a me\
re spectator of certain sport interactions and supporting teams by cheering and shouting can result in positive soci\
al behavior and overall happiness in general. Do you want to become both mentally comfort and physically fit? Sport \
is the answer.
